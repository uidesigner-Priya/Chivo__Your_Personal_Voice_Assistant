## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of Chivo running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chivo-voice-assistant.git
   cd chivo-voice-assistant
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install and import the required packages:
   ```sh
   from tkinter import * 
   pip install translate
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure that Tkinter is installed with standard python installation. You can verify this by trying to import tkinter in a Python script or interactive session:
     ```sh
     import tkinter
     print(tkinter.TkVersion)
   ```
     
    > [!NOTE]
    > If tkinter is not available or you encounter an import error, you might need to reinstall Python or
      ensure that tkinter was included during the installation process.
